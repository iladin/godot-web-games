"""Quick GitHub-issue check for the Game Factory (no credentials needed; the repo is public).

  python3 scripts/factory_issues.py          # print open issues that need attention
  python3 scripts/factory_issues.py --json   # same, as JSON

It lists open issues (pull requests are skipped), oldest first, and leaves out:
- issues already recorded in ai-studio/factory/ISSUES.md, unless the issue was updated after
  it was recorded (an edit, a new comment, or a reopen sends it back for another look);
- issues whose author isn't in state.json "issues.authors". These are printed under IGNORED
  so the run can record them, and are never acted on.
Issues are closed by commits whose message contains "Closes #N", once main is pushed.
